Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Solution:

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:

        def validate(node, low=-math.inf, high=math.inf):
            # Empty trees are valid BSTs.
            if not node:
                return True
            # The current node's value must be between low and high.
            if node.val <= low or node.val >= high:
                return False

            # The left and right subtree must also be valid.
            return (validate(node.right, node.val, high) and
                   validate(node.left, low, node.val))

        return validate(root)
